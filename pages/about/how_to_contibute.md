To make the Data Steward Handbook a success, we welcome contributions from data stewards and people with similar roles in and beyond the ELIXIR RDM Community. In this section we explain what we envision the various chapters to look like. 

# What contributors we are looking for
- Data stewards and people with similar roles who would write down their knowledge and experience for the Handbook content.
- Reviewers who want to provide feedback to existing pages. 
- Technicals and visual designers who can help plan the look-and-feel of the Handbook.

# How to get started
- Read the [About page](about) to have an idea what the Handbook is about. 
- Please contribute through [GitHub](TODO).
- Refer to existing resources where relevant (such as [RDMkit](https://rdmkit.elixir-europe.org/) or [Turing way](https://book.the-turing-way.org)), to avoid duplication and reinventing the wheel.

# What to include in the Handbook
Consider elements such as:
- Networking
- Team building
- Mandate
- Organisational structure
- Communication	
- Outreach
- Project management
- Resources
- Novel approaches
- Successful technologies

Please share your personal knowledge and experiences. The following questions might be helpful for that:
- What personal knowledge and experiences would benefit other data stewards in helping them get organized around the chapter topic?
- What type of experience sharing or examples from others would help you to perform better as a data steward?
- What steps would you suggest to implement local services around the chapter topic?
- What would you need from your organisation to offer better support regarding a chapter topic?   
- What pitfalls, challenges did you come across and solved in your organisation that could prevent others from reinventing the wheel. 
- What perspective, example, or approach could you share to help others discover different ways to organise the chapter topic within their organisation?

# What is out of scope
- If your example is helpful for **researchers**, then it should go to [RDMkit](https://rdmkit.elixir-europe.org/), [FAIR Cookbook](faircookbook.elixir-europe.org), [DSW](https://ds-wizard.org/), [FAIRsharing](https://fairsharing.org/) etc.
- If the information is meant for **roles other than the data steward**, such as for a privacy officer/DPO, information security officer, funders, etc.
- Training materials such as RDM presentations and  courses for the data steward should be in [TeSS](tess.elixir-europe.org).

# How to finish the page
- Please follow the [DS Handbook style guide](TODO). 
- Add complicated terms and abbreviations to the [Glossary](TODO).
- Remember to add your name into contributors yaml file (in _data/CONTRIBUTORS.yaml) and put your full name (exactly like in yaml file) into a metadata section of chapter(s) you are creating/modifying.
- For further info or help, contact [Mijke Jetten](mailto:mijke.jetten@health-ri.nl) (ELIXIR-NL, co-lead ELIXIR RDM Community).
